*An Exploratory Project Seeking to Understand the Shift of Tornado Alley*

Method 1: Regression -- Refer to the readme in the method_1_regression folder.

*Method 2: Using Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation to obtain peak latitude and longitude data, and next, using this data on three prediction methods: Linear Regression, Gaussian White Noise model, and Gaussian Random Walk. The results of the first two methods seemed more accurate. A forecast for the year 2030 has been provided to show where the tornado alley will be (including high-intensity tornadoes only). A check using testing data has also been performed.
